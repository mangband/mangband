 An Introduction to MAngband - by Warrior (warrior@mangband.org)

 Before you read this guide, listen to this bit of advice:
    "Don't get discouraged!! If you are new to mangband, you will 
    die... A lot. But, as you get more experienced, you will become 
    better at surviving and may even live to see level 20. Have fun!"
    - (Alex Dingle, maintainer 1998-2002)

 --- Part I -- The Basics ---

 1. What is MAngband? 

 MAngband is a free online multiplayer real-time roguelike game, derived from
 the single player game Angband. 

 2. What are all the strange letters and symbols? (@...t...*...)

 After creating a new character you will start in the tavern in town. 
 The white @ represents you, ... represents the floor/ground, * is a tree and 
 # a wall. The numbers (1-7) are stores, where you can buy new equipment and 
 sell stuff you've found in the dungeon. Monsters will (usually) be a colored 
 letter.

 3. What kind of equipment should I buy? 

 You start with some items related to your class, like magic books if you're a
 mage or a bow if you're a ranger. You should make sure you have at least the 
 following before entering the dungeon: A weapon, a brass lantern and some food.

 4. Ok - so what do I do now?

 The goal of the game is to kill Morgoth, Lord of Darkness. He lives 5000 feet 
 below the town so it's a pretty long walk. Luckily the dungeon is filled with
 other monsters for you to kill on your way down.

 5. How do I get into the dungeon?

 Hit 'M' to see the map. The entrance to the dungeon is the down staircase '>' 
 Press '>' when standing on it to enter. You can also use 'L' to look around.

 6. What happens when I die?

 You become a ghost. If your ghost dies your character is gone and you must 
 start over from level 1. Ghosts can pass through walls and drift up to town 
 by hitting '<'. Once you're back in town you can resurrect in the temple. 
 This will cost you half your experience points. If you don't want to resurrect 
 you can start over by hitting 'Q'. Ghosts also have certain undead powers, 'U'.

 --- Part II -- Macros ---

 If you want to survive in MAngband, you will have to learn some basic macros. 
 This is because the game is in realtime and the adventurer will often find 
 himself in situations where he won't have time to enter all the commands 
 manually. 
 
 A macro is a programmed key on your keyboard. You can program any key to do 
 whatever keypresses you'd like, in any order you'd like. Most people use the 
 function keys (F1-F12) for the macros because none of them are used for game 
 commands such as those mentioned in the beginning of this guide.

 Example 1: You're a Mage. Gain the spell Detect Creatures. Hit 'G' then 'a' 
 then 'b'. Inscribe your Beginners magic book with @m1. This gives your book
 a specific number instead of just a position in your inventory. Positions 
 may change as you drop items or if an item is destroyed so if you don't 
 give your book a number the macro might not find the right book. 
 This is VERY important.

 Push '%' to go to the macro-screen. Press '3' Enter a new action.
 Set the action as \em1b then hit enter. Press '5' Create Normal Macro. 
 Push F1 on your keyboard. You have now programmed the F1 key to execute the 
 Detect Creature spell.
 
 Now, hit Esc to get out of the macro menu. If you now try hitting F1 you will
 cast the Detect Creature spell. But why the \e part? and why choose a Normal
 Macro instead of a Command macro?  If you try to set \em1b as a command macro,
 the macro will ignore the \e.  The "\e" is the same as escape. So if you were
 doing something else,  like eating, quaffing, or gaining spells, and something
 bad happens, you want the macro to work! Immediately.

 Example 2: You're a Warrior.
 Inscribe your potion of Berserk Strength with @q1. Go to the macro-menu (%)
 and choose option (3), Enter a new action. Set the action as \eq1 Press (5),
 Create a Normal Macro, and press the key where you want this macro, F2 for
 example. Then hit Esc, and you're in the game again. When you now press F2
 it will quaff your potion of Berserk Strength.

 Example 3: You want to use a bow. Inscribe your arrows @f1. Set action
 as \ef1*t, and set it as normal macro. The *t is for targetting monsters.

 Thats it! Check out the online documentation for more info.
